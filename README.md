Thank you for viewing my Github profile 

As a self-taught programmer, my goal is to enter the industry at a beginner level 
in order to perfect and grow my knowledge of code, programming, and industry procedures.

Here are a few of the projects I have worked on in order to learn python language and techniques.

Enjoy and please comment!
